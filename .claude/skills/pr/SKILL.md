# Create a Pull Request

Create a GitHub pull request for the current branch, transition the linked Jira ticket to review, and record the pull request URL on that ticket.

## Preconditions

- At least one commit adds tests. When none do, ask the user for a rationale and refuse to proceed without one. The only exceptions are pull requests with no code changes (e.g., language key updates or markdown changes).

- The current branch is a development branch, not `master` or any other protected branch.

- The working tree has no uncommitted changes. When dirty, abort and ask the user to commit first (suggest `/commit`); do not stash or discard their work.

- Unless `${ARGUMENTS}` contains `--skip-pr-check`, the `pr-check` skill must pass. See **Run pr-check** below.

## Input

### Branch

The current Git branch must contain the commits ready to ship.

### Jira Ticket

Resolve a ticket key in priority order:

1. **User Argument** — when `${ARGUMENTS}` supplies a ticket key, prefer that value.

1. **Branch Name** — extract the ticket from the current branch (e.g., branch `LPD-83847` yields ticket `LPD-83847`).

1. **Recent Commits** — when neither produces a ticket, scan recent commit messages for a ticket prefix.

1. **Fallback** — when nothing surfaces, prompt the user.

The ticket key follows the pattern `LPD-12345`, `LCD-12345`, `LRCI-1234`, and similar forms (uppercase letters, hyphen, digits).

### Target Repository

The target repository defaults to `<fork-owner>/liferay-portal`. When `${ARGUMENTS}` names a different `org/repo`, use that; when it matches an alias below, expand the alias; otherwise, ask the user to choose `<fork-owner>` from one of the team forks:

- `liferay-ac`
- `liferay-appsec`
- `liferay-bpm`
- `liferay-commerce`
- `liferay-content-management`
- `liferay-core-infra`
- `liferay-database-infra`
- `liferay-devtools`
- `liferay-frontend`
- `liferay-headless`
- `liferay-page-management`
- `liferay-platform-experience`
- `liferay-search`
- `liferay-site-management`

The following short aliases resolve to a target repository:

- `brian` → `brianchandotcom/liferay-portal`

The pull request head is `<github-username>:<branch-name>` (the GitHub username is read from the user's `origin` remote URL — e.g., `git@github.com:brianchandotcom/liferay-portal.git` yields `brianchandotcom`), and the base is `master`.

## Run pr-check

When `${ARGUMENTS}` contains `--skip-pr-check`, skip this step. Note the skip in the plan summary so the developer is aware that **Pushed Branch** will not post a `pr-check` commit status and **Pull Request** will not apply the `pr-check - success` label.

Otherwise, invoke the `pr-check` skill, passing the ticket resolved in **Jira Ticket** as its argument so pr-check does not have to re-resolve it. pr-check validates the branch, executes the validation script in the background, evaluates the outcome, and may auto-commit drift output (Service Builder, REST Builder, Instance Wrapper Build) and source-format changes — those commits land before the push, so the pushed branch already includes them.

When pr-check reports failure, stop. Do not push or open a PR; the developer needs to address the failure before retrying `/pr`.

When pr-check reports success, proceed to **Expected Output**.

## Expected Output

### Pushed Branch

Push the current branch to the user's remote when it has not been pushed yet or when new local commits exist (including any auto-commits from **Run pr-check**).

When pr-check ran and passed, post a GitHub commit status to the head SHA so the PR opens with the local pr-check run reflected:

```bash
gh api \
	--field "context=pr-check" \
	--field "description=All pr-check validations passed locally" \
	--field "state=success" \
	--method POST \
	"repos/<github-username>/liferay-portal/statuses/$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

The status posts to the fork that hosts the SHA — `<github-username>` from **Target Repository** — not the target repo where the PR lands. When the API call fails, surface the error and continue with PR creation; the developer can post the status manually afterward.

When pr-check was skipped (via `--skip-pr-check`), do not post a status. The absence of the status is the honest signal — pr-check did not run, so there is nothing to report.

### Pull Request

The title is concise (under 72 characters) and prefixed with the Jira ticket:

```
LPD-83847 Fix OutOfMemoryError during batch engine import
```

The body follows this format:

```markdown
https://liferay.atlassian.net/browse/TICKET-ID

## What is being fixed

Explain the problem or bug that motivated the change — what was going
wrong or what was missing.

## How it is being fixed

Explain the approach taken across all commits. Describe the key changes
and the reasoning behind the approach. Write in plain prose rather than
bullet points.

## Why are there no tests?

This optional section is only included when the commits do not add any
tests. It should contain the rationale provided by the user.
```

Use a direct, to-the-point style. Avoid being verbose. Present the proposed title and body to the user before submitting, and proceed once they approve.

When pr-check ran and passed, apply the `pr-check - success` label to the newly created PR. The color matches the team's existing CI success labels (for example, `ci:test:sf - success`).

**Cross-fork tolerance.** When the target repository is not `<github-username>/liferay-portal` — the PR lands on a teammate's fork or upstream where the developer lacks write access — both the label create (HTTP 404) and the label apply (HTTP 403) calls will fail. Skip the label step entirely in that case and surface a one-line note in the summary: the pr-check status is still posted on `<github-username>/liferay-portal` at the head SHA, so reviewers who want to see it can navigate to the commit on the source fork. The PR check rollup on the target repo will not show pr-check, since GitHub statuses are scoped per-repository and only repo collaborators can post them — this is a known limitation of cross-fork PRs, not a skill bug.

When the target repository **is** `<github-username>/liferay-portal`, ensure the label exists (idempotent — the create call fails harmlessly when the label is already present):

```bash
gh label create "pr-check - success" \
	--color c7e8cb \
	--description "pr-check passed locally" \
	--repo <target-org>/liferay-portal 2>/dev/null || true
```

Apply it to the PR:

```bash
gh pr edit <PR-number> \
	--add-label "pr-check - success" \
	--repo <target-org>/liferay-portal
```

When pr-check was skipped, do not apply the label.

### Transitioned Jira Ticket

Fetch the input ticket (issue type, status, subtasks) and resolve the **target ticket** — the one whose status reflects active work and on which the pull request URL is recorded:

| Ticket Type | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Bug (`10004`) | The bug itself |
| Task (`10002`) | Its Technical Task (`10153`) subtask |
| Technical Task (`10153`) | Itself |

When the target is not already in an in-progress status, transition it first:

| Target Type | Destination | Transition ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bug | In Progress | `61` |
| Technical Task | In Progress | `41` |

Then transition it to review:

| Target Type | Destination | Transition ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bug | In Review | `71` |
| Technical Task | In Peer Review | `31` |

When the review transition fails (for example, because the ticket is already in a later status), still proceed to record the pull request URL.

Set the **Git Pull Request** field (`customfield_10201`) on the target ticket to the new pull request URL.

### Existing Pull Request

When the **Git Pull Request** field already holds one or more pull request URLs, ask the user whether the new pull request **supersedes** the existing one or is **added** alongside it.

When the user chooses **supersede**:

1. Overwrite **Git Pull Request** with the new pull request URL, dropping the previous value.

1. Add a comment on the previous pull request, linking to the new one (for example, `Superseded by <new-pr-url>.`).

1. Close the previous pull request when possible. When the user lacks permission to close it directly, add a `ci:close` comment instead, so the CI bot closes it.

When the user chooses **add**:

1. Append the new pull request URL to the existing value, separating each URL with a comma and a space.

### Summary

Report back to the user with:

- The Jira ticket status and link.
- The pull request URL.
